 Here the question we needs to understand one thing which is they have given only at most one wrong character out of
 palindrom string,

 since we need to find the where the miss match occurs in that case either one of the char should be the ans, we will give 
 it to next helper method with holding two different chars

 it is like incrementing the left+1,right this is case 1, assuming the left is not palindrom chars
 left,right-1 removing the right char is nothing but right char is not

var validPalindrome = function(s) {
    let left=0, right=s.length-1;

    while(left<right){
        if(s.charAt(left)!=s.charAt(right)){
            return (checkPalindrom(left+1,right,s) || checkPalindrom(left,right-1,s));
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
};

function checkPalindrom(l,r,str){
   
 while(l<r){
    if(str.charAt(l)!=str.charAt(r)){
        return false;
    }
    l++;
    r--;
}

return true;
}
