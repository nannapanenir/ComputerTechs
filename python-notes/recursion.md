A recursion is nothing but calling same function again and again until it hit the base case ! that means like lets take an example here. we want to calculte  5!,5! is nothing but  5*4*3*2*1=120, here we can achineve this in two ways in programming that is like 

By taking a simple for loop i.e 
    res=1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        res*=i
    print(res)

it will give same result as doing recursion call that is calling functions again and again till we hit the base case


but why we need recursion  :

    Tree-Like Structures: Recursive algorithms often align perfectly with tree traversals (e.g., depth-first search, preorder, inorder, postorder) and graph algorithms, leading to clear and maintainable code.

    Divide and Conquer: Recursion breaks down complex problems into smaller, self-similar subproblems, making them easier to reason about and solve independently.
    Specific Algorithms:

    Tail Recursion: Some algorithms, like quicksort and merge sort, are naturally recursive and can be optimized using tail recursion for efficiency.

    Dynamic Programming: Recursion is essential for solving dynamic programming problems that involve overlapping subproblems.

I hope you understand that why we need the recursion , we will go little bit deeper into the recursion pattern how does it works when we call any recursion function. 

Let's take an example above code using recursion

def recursion(n):
     if n == 1:
         return 1
     else:         
         return n * factorial(n-1)

recursion() # function call happening 


when function(recursion() ) start exection it will create a list of call stack, as depicts in image-1

![Alt text](image\image-1.png)

Similarly it is going to create a list of call stack till we hit the base case you can see it in below image-2 ![Alt text](image\image-2.png) as depicts in the image the left side of image we see that the list of call stacks 

once we hit the base case , call stack pop's the each stack at a time returns the value it has. Remember that is going to happen in way that the STACK which is last in, it will come first out 

last stack returns base case that is return 1 , after that stack got poped out it will go to next last stack.

returned-  1
1 => 1 * laststack(inside we have -1 ) it returns value- > 1
2 => this stack has 2 and the above stack has 1 -> now this two will multiplayed and it gets poped out -> 2*last-stack value
3 => similarly we will have 3* last stack value is 2 -> now it becomes 6
4 => 4 * 6 -> 24 
5 => 5 * 24 -> 120

now the our functions has not have any stacks it will just return the output
