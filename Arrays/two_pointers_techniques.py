"""
In sorted arrays, the two-pointer technique stands out as a powerful method for efficiently finding pairs of elements that meet a specific condition.

Problem:

Given a sorted array A with N integers, arranged in ascending order, determine whether any pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) exists such that their sum is precisely X.

Key Points:

Sorted Array: The crucial prerequisite for this technique is a sorted array.
Two Pointers: It strategically employs two pointers, each pointing to distinct elements within the array.
Efficient Pair Search: These pointers traverse the array, collaboratively identifying pairs that satisfy the given condition.
Linear Time Complexity: Notably, this technique typically achieves a linear time complexity of O(N), making it highly efficient for pair-finding in sorted arrays.
